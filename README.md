# README.md for discount_function assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Python script designed to calculate the final price of an item ater applying a discount. The script provides a function `calculate_discount` that determines the final price based on the original price and the discount percentage. The discount is only applied if it is 20% or higher.

## Function
The core functionality is encapsulated in a function named `calculate_discount`, which takes two parameters:

#### `price`:
 The original price of the item.
#### `discount_percent`:
 The percentage discount to be applied.
The function returns the final price after considering the discount. If the discount percentage is less than 20%, the original price is returned.

## Usage
The script prompts the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. It then prints the final price after applying the discount, or the original price if the discount is less than 20%.
